    "## Data Security & Privacy in Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore ways to incorporate data security and privacy into large-scale data workflows. First, you might be wondering why we need to worry about these topics. Shouldn't this be a problem solved by the privacy department, infosec or via product owners? \n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of large scale data workflows like folks who manage the internet. We don't often see their work, but we know when it's broken! They probably deserve a lot more credit and attention for it, but we somehow just expect it \"to work ubiquitously.\" And we certainly expect the data we send around the internet to be kept private and secure (although in some geographies it is less likely...). If it wasn't for the work on those large-scale packet pipelines, then we couldn't trust technologies like SSL, TLS or our web applications or mobile applications. Those are enabled, propogated and enforced by all the intermediary hops, meaning the packet and data are handled with the same promises as they arrived. Hopefully you are getting the picture here -- security and privacy have to be baked into the architecture and data flow from the start, and cannot be simply \"tacked on\" at a given endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we understand our responsibilities as the folks building the data backbones. What privacy and security concerns do we actually have? We'll walk through a concrete example to have a look!"

    "- **Confidentiality:** Data is kept confidential, meaning only those who should be able to access it can do so, and fine-tuned access is available and enforced.\n",
    "- **Integrity:** Data is accurate and cannot easily be changed or tampered with by internal or external actors in a malicious way.\n",

    "### What about Privacy? 🦹🏻\n",
    "\n",
    "A foundational concept when it comes to designing privacy-respecting systems is the Privacy by Design principles outlined by [Anne Cavoukian in 2006](https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/pbd_implement_7found_principles.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pull out a few of the principles that relate to our work as data engineers...\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial:** Privacy is built into our architecture and data flows as we start building them. Think of this as the privacy version of TDD -- we write the privacy requirements first and design and build systems to fit them, not the other way around!\n",
    "- **Privacy as the Default Setting:** We optimize systems so that privacy is on by default, and changes to that are user-driven! This means tracking things like consent, implementing processes for data minimization and ensuring lineage and governance data is available to data consumers or dependant data products.\n",
    "- **Full Functionality – Positive-Sum, not Zero-Sum:** Data privacy is a benefit for the business, technologists and users, meaning we ensure that it is not a tradeoff in our product design. Users who choose privacy protections (or users who have them on automatically, by default, right?) receive full functionality.\n",
    "- **End-to-End Security – Full Lifecycle Protection:** Data is secured properly and for it's entire lifecycle (from collection endpoint to deletion!). Here is our big intersection with the security requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this mean for our data engineering work?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our data workflows have privacy protections outlined and architected in before any code is written. We test for these and ensure they are working properly, should anything change.\n",
    "- Privacy is turned on by default, and any \"unknown\" data flows have privacy added to them when they enter into our systems or are discovered (e.g. in cases of unknown data storages or data from third parties).\n",
    "- We work directly with data producers and consumers (and other stakeholders, such as legal or privacy professionals) to find sweet spots that offer the appropriate protection for users and utility for business needs. Approach this as a postive-sum game and remember that user-centric choices are always a good business investment.\n",
    "- We design secure workflows that ensure that all user-related or person-related data is properly secured using standards from data security best practices (like our CIA triad!)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Privacy and Information Continuum\n",
    "\n",
    "One useful way to begin shifting your understanding of privacy is to start thinking about it as a point on a spectrum instead of something that is \"on\" or \"off\". Here we can see that we can have a full range of points on a continuum, where privacy and information are somewhat at odds with one another. When we have full information, we have no privacy guarantees. When we have complete privacy, we cannot do our job as data people! Finding the right balance is the difficult and fun part of privacy in data science!"

As you may have noticed, it wasn't always obvious what we should do -- but by thinking through each data type and determining what worked to balance the utility of the data and the privacy we want to offer, we were able to find some ways to protect individuals. \n",
